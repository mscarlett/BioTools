BioTools
========

Python tools for computational biology and bioinformatics research. The goal of this project is to improve the tools available in existing open source libraries such as BioPython and BioConductor with the possibility that any useful code can be incorporated into such libraries. The project currently consists of the following modules:

affy - Tools for processing Affymetrix microarray data

cvsim - Simulation of the cardiovascular system

geo - Tools for extracting data from the Gene Expresion Omnibus (GEO) database

neurosim - Biological models for simulation of a group of neurons

omim - Tools for extracting data from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database

uniprot - Tools for extracting data from the UniProt database
